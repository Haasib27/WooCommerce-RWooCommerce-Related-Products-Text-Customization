# WooCommerce-RWooCommerce-Related-Products-Text-Customization
This snippet replaces the "Related Products" text with a custom phrase. Despite using Loco Translate, the default WooCommerce translation for "Related Products" might not change. Adding this code to your theme's functions.php file solves the issue.


# Add the code from woocommerce-related-products-text-customization.php file to your theme's functions.php file.

# How It Works:

    Filters: The snippet uses gettext and ngettext filters to intercept the default text strings before they are displayed.
    Translation Array: An associative array is used to map the default text ('Related Products') to the desired text ('Check out these related products').
    String Replacement: The str_ireplace function performs a case-insensitive search and replace operation on the intercepted text strings.

# How to Apply in File Manager

    Access File Manager: Login to your hosting account and navigate to the File Manager.
    Locate Theme Directory: Go to wp-content/themes/your-theme-name.
    Edit functions.php: Open functions.php and paste the code snippet at the end of the file.
    Save Changes: Save the file and refresh your website to see the changes.
